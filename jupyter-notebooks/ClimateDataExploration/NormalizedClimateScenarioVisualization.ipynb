    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sust Global's climate scenario analysis datasets allow operational risk analysts, quantitative modellers and ESG analysts to assess historic, near term and long term impacts of climate change. We provide historic risk exposure scores for fires, floods and cyclones over the past 11 years (Jan 2010- Dec 2020). For forward looking projections of extreme physical climate hazards, we provide risk exposures across standardized climate scenarios. In this User Guide, we give an overview of the outputs from climate scenario analysis and describe the hazards that we are covering in our analysis. We describe the different views in our platform and provide guidance on interpreting the results from our climate scenario analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Hazard Modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "We model rising temperatures and varying precipitation at the asset level.  We report on 5 physical hazards: Wildfire, floods, heatwaves, droughts (SPEI) and sea level rise (SLR). The modelled results are stored as time series for each specific asset within the portfolio of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on our dataset, descriptio of climate scenarios and risk modalities and value ranges can be found in our [Climate Scenario Analysis User Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ksBEYJexyLafInkZzEbcLnb3Kuc5eVsx/view) which also outlines a collection of technical references. \n",
