            <h1>Climate Explorer Quickstart Guide</h1>
            <p>Climate Explorer is available at <a href="https://explorer.sustglobal.io">https://explorer.sustglobal.io</a>.
This UI enables Sust Global customers to manage their physical asset portfolios and gain insights regarding climate risk exposure.</p>

<p>Developers are encouraged to integrate with Climate Explorer through the API.
Please read the <a href="./api.html">Climate Explorer API Guide</a> to learn about these capabilities.</p>

<p>Climate Explorer is currently in beta and will be generally available in mid 2022.
If you do not yet have a Climate Explorer account, please contact <a href="mailto:sales@sustglobal.com">sales@sustglobal.com</a>.</p>

<h1 id="introductory-video">Introductory Video</h1>

<p>Welcome to Climate Explorer - this video will provide a walkthrough of how to upload your assets, autogenerate the risk exposure report and populate a dashboard with the results of that analysis. We will then go over how to derive climate scenario analysis outcomes from the dashboard view for your analysis, assessment and reporting needs.</p>

<h1 id="climate-scenarios">Climate Scenarios</h1>

<p>This tool covers the following three distinct climate scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strong Mitigation:</strong> This scenario covers the optimal sustainable path, also referred to as the Green Road (SSP1-RCP2.6). It encompasses socioeconomics and representative emissions pathways for a graduate and pervasive global shift towards a more sustainable future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Middle of the Road:</strong> This scenario covers a middle path, with challenges to climate mitigation (SSP2-RCP4.5). In this scenario, environmental systems experience degradation, and although there are some improvements. overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. This is a likely scenario if governments and policy reflect a strong sense of urgency towards climate adaptation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>High Emissions:</strong> This scenario covers a future where the world continues on its current trajectory (SSP5-RCP8.5). There is continued reliance on competitive markets to produce rapid technological progress. Global markets are increasingly integrated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="projects-in-climate-explorer">Projects in Climate Explorer</h1>

<p>As a user of Climate Explorer, you can manage collections of physical assets as “portfolios”, each of which can be represented as a CSV file. Projects act as logical groupings of portfolios, and users are assigned permissions at the scope of a project: either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">viewer</code> (read only) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">editor</code> (ability to create new portfolios). As a user, you will typically have access to multiple projects. For example, Sust Global will provide you with viewer access to a demo project containing demo portfolios, as well as editor access to one or more projects where you can create your own portfolios.</p>

<h1 id="create-new-portfolios">Create New Portfolios</h1>

<p>To create a new portfolio go to the <a href="https://explorer.sustglobal.io/portfolios/">Portfolio View</a> on Climate Explorer and click on the button labelled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Portfolio</code>. When creating a new portfolio, make sure that the name has no gaps in it. Having given the portfolio a name, you can upload information on the phyical assets.</p>

<p>An example of a portfolio CSV file can be found in the Developer Center: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sustglobal/dev-center/master/resources/example_portfolio.csv">demo portfolio</a>. This demo portfolio is a useful starting point if you are  interested in building their own portfolio for use in Climate Explorer, whether via UI or API. Simply save the link to the demo portfolio as a CSV file and edit it before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uploading assets</code> on the <a href="https://explorer.sustglobal.io/portfolios/">Portfolio View</a> on Climate Explorer.</p>

<p>Each of the supported fields in the portfolio CSV file are documented below:</p>

<p>Note that the geocodes (lat/lng coordinates) of all the physical assets in your portfolio are required. If you only have addresses and not the geocodes, you can use the <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/geocoding/">Mapbox Geocoding Playground</a> to secure geocodes for a specific address. Alternately, you can also secure the geocodes from <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">Google Maps</a>.
Please note that portfolios are currently limited to 5000 assets in size. Additionally account level portfolio size limits might apply. Please contact <a href="mailto:sales@sustglobal.com">sales@sustglobal.com</a> if you would like to increase your portfolio size limits.</p>

<h1 id="interpret-results">Interpret results</h1>

<p>As a user of Climate Explorer, you can download physical risk exposure projection results on their portfolio. Once you have created a new portfolio and uploaded assets, wait for the status to update to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Risk data available</code>. Once data is available, you can bulk download the risk exposure dataset as a zip file using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download Risk Exposure</code> option. You can also switch over to the <a href="https://explorer.sustglobal.io/">Dashboard View</a>, select the specific portfolio you created and view the results on the interactive dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="historic-reporting-outcomes">
<a class="anchor" href="#historic-reporting-outcomes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Historic Reporting Outcomes</h2>

<p>All reports are generated at a monthly cadence based on observations and historic catalogs covering the months from Jan 2010 to Dec 2020. Some of our datasets allow for
higher cadence reporting, please contact us for custom requests.</p>

<h2 id="forward-looking-reporting-outcomes">
<a class="anchor" href="#forward-looking-reporting-outcomes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Forward Looking Reporting Outcomes</h2>

<p>All reports and supported risk projections are at annual cadence. Some of our datasets allow for higher cadence reporting, please contact us for custom requests.</p>

<p>For creating standard heatmaps, we assess the physical risk over the 30 year window between 2021 and 2050 and look at the maximum risk exposure to a specific hazard for an asset. We use the maximum risk exposure value to color code the asset to LOW (Green), MEDIUM (Yellow), HIGH (Red) risk categories.</p>
