<p>Sust Global enables users to access physical risk data across multiple perils and forward-looking time horizons. We take comprehensive measures to ensure data is validated and precise, so users can make climate-informed decisions.</p>

<p>This document provides users with an introduction to Sust Global’s data capabilities. This includes an overview of climate modeling and scenario development, and how to use our hazard and indicator data to derive intelligence and insights.</p>

<p>Our Climate Analytics covers risk from multiple perils:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./dataguide_hazards/wildfire.html">Wildfire</a></li>
  <li>Flood</li>
  <li>Cyclone</li>
  <li>Heatwave</li>
  <li>Sea Level Rise (SLR)</li>
  <li>Water Stress</li>
</ul>

<p>We do this by integrating General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the latest international modeling efforts (CMIP6) with high-resolution historic observations from satelites and sensors, using the latest machine-learning and artificial intelligence methods. This allows us to deliver spatial resolution that is orders of magnitudes finer than GCMs alone. Analysis sites can be supplied in the form of either points or regions/polygons, and risk exposure is delivered as a time series for each specific asset.</p>

<p><strong>Data Validation</strong>: For every hazard, we derive asset level exposure data from forward looking indicators based on models from frontier climate science. We benchmark and validate data from these indicators on their hindcast (projections over historic time periods) against observations to qualify the most performant functional models used in our model ensembles.</p>

<p>To model future climate change, some assumptions about society are needed - particularly, the quantity of planet-warming greenhouse gases that will be emitted over the coming decades.  There are established conventions for this, known as “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways”, or SSPs, that are used to standardize this assumption across models.  These climate scenarios can be thought of as a bundling of working hypotheses on the evolution of human development over the coming years. For an overview of climate scenario definitions, as set forth by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), see this article <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/">Carbon Brief</a>.</p>

<p>Sust Global’s data covers three of the most representative scenarios from the IPCC:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Strong Mitigation (SSP1)</strong>: SSP1 covers the optimal sustainable path, also referred to as the Green Road (SSP1-RCP2.6). It encompasses socioeconomic and representative emissions pathways consistent with a sustained and pervasive global shift towards a more sustainable future. Carbon emissions begin to decline around 2020 and global mean temperatures rise approximately 1.8°C by 2100, a key goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Middle of the Road (SSP2)</strong>: SSP2 covers a middle path, with challenges to climate mitigation (SSP2-RCP4.5). In this scenario, In this scenario, overall emissions continue to rise through mid-century before beginning to decline, environmental systems experience severe degradation, and climate change worsens through the end of the century. This is widely considered the likely scenario if governments and policy reflect a strong sense of urgency towards climate adaptation. Global mean temperatures rise approximately 2.4°C by 2100, but greater emissions raise the risk of tipping points.</li>
  <li>
<strong>High Emissions (SSP5)</strong>: SSP5 reflects a future where the world continues on its current trajectory, also referred to as Fossil-Fueled Growth (SSP5-RCP8.5). In this scenario, both total population and per-capita consumption increase. Emissions peak around 2090 and global mean temperatures rising approximately 4.3°C by 2100.</li>
</ol>
