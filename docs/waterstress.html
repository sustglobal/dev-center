            <h1>Climate Data Guide - Water Stress</h1>
            <p><strong>Hazard Description</strong></p>

<p>Water is a requirement for societal development and progress, and its availability plays a critical role across a wide variety of activities.  This includes food security, human health, electricity generation, manufacturing and mining. Changing water availability due to climate change, coupled with increasing demand from population growth and economic activity, will have substantial impacts across the globe. Rigorous, high resolution water supply and demand data is therefore needed to enable assessment of water risk exposure, both directly and throughout supply chains. Projections of future water availability can help companies and investors prepare for the complex economic and social challenges related to water stress.</p>

<h2 id="methodologies">
<a class="anchor" href="#methodologies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methodologies</h2>
<p><strong>Unified Water Stress</strong> 
This indicator combines the water stress score and the drought indicator to one single indicator for water stress, using a weighted mean, with weights derived from the methodology designed by the World Resources Institute in their <a href="https://doi.org/10.46830/writn.18.00146">Global Aqueduct Methodology</a> (Page 35, Table 3). This provides a comparable 0.0 to 1.0 range to indicate exposure to water stress.</p>

<p>Unified Water Stress is the recommended default indicator for future water stress risk.</p>

<p><strong>Aqueduct Water Stress Score</strong>: The World Resource Institute’s <i>Aqueduct</i> models future water stress risk. This state-of-the-art model has been extensively used by researchers in academia and industry to assess portfolio water risk. The water stress score is calculated as the ratio of water withdrawal to renewable water availability, and is indicative of competition for local water resources.</p>

<p><strong>SPEI Drought</strong>: Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is a drought index base on precipitation and temperature.  Our product applied this index to NASA’s Global Downscaled Daily Projections <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nex/gddp">GDDP</a>. SPEI represents the magnitude of precipitation deficits or surplus over the preceding 12-month period, after accounting for temperature-driven effects on evapotranspiration.</p>

<p><strong>Historic Water Stress</strong>
We use the same methodology as the unified water stress indicator, except with observed rather than modeled datasets of water stress and drought.</p>

<h2 id="risk-scoring">
<a class="anchor" href="#risk-scoring" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Risk Scoring</h2>
<p>Where did we benchmark water stress?</p>

<h2 id="known-limitations">
<a class="anchor" href="#known-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Limitations</h2>
<p>…
Unified Water Stress does not have a tangible interpretation, in the same way that other metrics do (probability, heatwave days, m SLR).
Our modeling framework does not account for water transport between watersheds, which helps to meet demand in dry regions at the cost of transportation.</p>

<p><strong>Indicators</strong></p>

<p>We provide 4 indicators: historic water stress, projected droughts, projected water stress score, projected unified water stress.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Water stress score indicator</strong>: We model current and forward-looking water stress scores using the World Resource Institute’s Aqueduct model. The state-of-the-art Aqueduct model has been extensively used by researchers in academia and industry to assess portfolio water risk. The water stress score is indicative of competition for local water resources. It is calculated as the ratio of water withdrawal to renewable water availability.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Drought indicator</strong>: This indicator is based on a drought index derived from CMIP6 monthly simulations of precipitation and temperature. The drought index, also referred to as the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, represents the magnitude of precipitation deficits (negative magnitude) or surplus (positive magnitude) over the preceding 12-month period, after accounting for temperature-driven effects on evapotranspiration. Our selection of a 12-month period reflects long-term precipitation patterns and better relates to reservoirs, groundwater, and streamflow.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Unified water stress indicator</strong>: This indicator combines the water stress score and the drought indicator to one single indicator for water stress, using a weighted mean, with weights derived from the methodology designed by the World Resources Institute in their <a href="https://doi.org/10.46830/writn.18.00146">Global Aqueduct Methodology</a> (Page 35, Table 3). This provides a comparable 0.0 to 1.0 range to indicate exposure to water stress.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Historic water stress indicator</strong>: We use the same methodology as the unified water stress indicator, except with observed rather than modeled datasets of water stress and drought.</li>
</ol>

<p>Water stress scores account for the availability and consumption of water at the specific location. The drought indicator accounts for environmental variables that create acute water shortage over a period of time. Both are chronic physical climate hazard indicators.</p>

<p>Our water stress indicator is based on the world leading WRI water stress methodology (<a href="https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-global-maps-30-data">link</a>) and our drought indicator is based on the latest frontier climate research from the CMIP6(<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3740-8">link</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Data Usage</strong></p>

<p>A key avenue for mitigating water stress not considered in the modeling framework is the transport of water between watersheds. Such transport can help meet water demand, but it comes at a cost. Transporting water requires large amounts of energy, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, along with the development of transportation infrastructure. Water transport also carries with it a host of geopolitical and equity considerations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water stress scores are more suitable for use for assessments of impact from the changing climate to human water needs</li>
  <li>Drought indicator is most useful for water stress impacts to agriculture and commodities</li>
  <li>The unified water stress indicator is most useful across generic use cases</li>
</ul>
