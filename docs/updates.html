<p><strong>Data Product Updates</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Increased resolution drought and heatwave: We have enabled high resolution climate data for the drought (hazard: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">water_stress</code> indicator: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spei_norm</code>) and heatwave (hazard: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heatwave</code>) datasets. This increases the resolution of these datasets from 1 degree to 0.25 degree. These indicators are derived from NASA Global Daily Downscaled Projections <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nex/gddp">(NEX-GDDP)</a>.</li>
  <li>Historic flood data: We have introduced high resolution satellite derived observed flooding for our historic exposure time series. The time series represent binary observed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flood/no flood</code> at the asset location at an annual cadence. This dataset is at a spatial resolution of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">250 meters</code>, available globally and derived from the <a href="https://cdn.earthdata.nasa.gov/conduit/upload/17162/MCDWD_UserGuide_RevB.pdf">NASA MODIS NRT Global Flood</a> dataset.</li>
  <li>Historic fire data: We have introduced high resolution satellite derived observed wildfire for our historic exposure time series. The time series represent binary observed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fire/no fire</code> within 1 km of the asset location at a monthly cadence. This dataset is at a spatial resolution of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">500 meters</code>, available globally and derived from the <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/115/MCD64_ATBD_V6.pdf">NASA MODIS Active Burned Area</a> dataset.</li>
  <li>We have updated the developer center documentation to reflect changes to our <a href="./userguide.html">User Guide</a> and introduced our new <a href="./csvdatasetguide.html">CSV Dataset Guide</a> and <a href="./dataguide.html">Data Guide</a>. The <a href="./dataguide.html">Data Guide</a> includes visual representations of our global exposure maps at the US county level and select regions around the world and lists of the most exposed administrative regions in these slect geographies.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>New Product Features</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Introducing the new unified wildfire indicator as an additional indicator for forward looking scenario based projections in Climate Explorer and the Sust Global API
    <ol>
      <li>This indicator combines the projections from the burned area fraction and the KBDI susceptibility score, benchmarked against the observed wildfire indicator to create a unified measure of wildfire probability within 1 km of a specific location. It can be interpreted as the probability of wildfire occurring within one kilometer of an asset location within a given year. The unified wildfire indicator when aggregated over a period of time (10 yrs) provides for a measure of probability of wildfire occurrence within 1 kilometer of the asset over the next 10 years. The native resolution of this indicator is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">300 meters</code>.</li>
      <li>This new unified wildfire indicator is surfaced when selecting the hazard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wildfire</code> using the drop down on Climate Explorer</li>
      <li>The unified wildfire indicator is used for deriving the summary scores and summary labels in Climate Explorer and for the CSV datasets.</li>
      <li>The unified wildfire indicator is available through API using the filters hazard: <strong>wildfire</strong> and indicator name: <strong>unified_prob</strong>
</li>
      <li>Previously available wildfire indicators <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">burned_area_norm</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fire_kbdi_susceptability</code> will continue to be available through the API and the CSV datasets but not available in the dashboard view in Climate Explorer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing the new unified water stress indicator as an additional indicator for forward looking scenario based projections in Climate Explorer and the Sust Global API
    <ol>
      <li>This indicator combines the water stress score and the drought indicator to one single indicator for water stress, using a weighting methodology designed by the World Resources Institute in their <a href="https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-global-maps-30-data">Global Aqueduct Methodology</a>. This provides a comparable 0.0 to 1.0 range to indicate exposure to water stress. The native resolution of this indicator is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">500 meters</code>.</li>
      <li>This new unified water stress indicator is what is surfaced when selecting the hazard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Water Stress</code> using the drop down on Climate Explorer</li>
      <li>The unified water stress indicator is used for deriving the summary scores and summary labels in Climate Explorer and for the CSV datasets.</li>
      <li>The unified water stress indicator is available through API using the filters hazard: <strong>water_stress</strong> and indicator name: <strong>unified_score</strong>
</li>
      <li>Previously available water stress indicators <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">score</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spei_norm</code> will continue to be available through the API and the CSV datasets but not available in the dashboard view in Climate Explorer.</li>
      <li>Water stress scores (hazard: <strong>water_stress</strong>, indicator: <strong>score</strong>) are now capped at an upper limit of 1.0 instead of 4.0. A value of 1.0 indicates that annual water demand is equal to or exceeds the annual renewable supply. Demand can exceed renewable supply when non-renewable water sources like aquifers are accessed. The normalization value for standardizing values between 0.0 and 1.0 is now 1.0 instead of 4.0. This change impacts the magnitude of water stress score values given in the summary score CSVs.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing the new historic water stress indicator as an additional historic indicator in Climate Explorer and the Sust Global API
    <ol>
      <li>For this indicator, we use the same methodology as the unified water stress indicator, except with observed rather than modeled datasets of water stress and drought.</li>
      <li>The historic water stress indicator is available through API using the filters hazard: hazard: <strong>water_stress</strong>  and indicator name: <strong>obs_score</strong>.</li>
      <li>Water stress scores are now capped at an upper limit of 1.0 instead of 4.0. A value of 1.0 indicates that annual water demand is equal to or exceeds the annual renewable supply. Demand can exceed renewable supply when non-renewable water sources like aquifers are accessed. The normalization value for standardizing values between 0.0 and 1.0 is now 1.0 instead of 4.0. This change impacts the magnitude of water stress score values displayed in the Climate Explorer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Normalized multi-hazard time series view</code> plot.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing two new forward looking exposure time series plots and reporting options:
    <ol>
      <li>
<strong>Decadal summary time series</strong>: A new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Decadal Summary</code> view has been enabled for forward looking risk, which presents decadal summaries based on 10 year moving averages at 5 year offsets. This provides a representative view of risk exposure for the selected hazard for the selected scenario.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Relative Change summary</strong>: A new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Relative Change Summary</code> view has been enabled for forward looking risk, which presents relative change based on 30 year averages from the 1980-2010 and the 2020-2050 time windows. We also quantify the relative change as a percentage of past exposure in the dashboard view.</li>
    </ol>

<p><strong>Data Change to Error Bar Calculations</strong></p>

<p>As of May 1, 2022, we have made an update to how we estimate risk in order to more accurately represent uncertainty and the spread of modeled outcomes. Our error bars will now show the 16th and 84th percentile of represented models, rather than +/- one standard deviation.  Additionally, projections will show median instead of mean values, reducing the influence of outlier projections from our models.  Correspondingly, our Low/Medium/High calculations are now based on median values instead of mean values. <em>This feature has not yet been rolled out for cyclones.</em></p>

<p><strong>Drought Indicator Data Rescale</strong></p>

<p>Beginning May 1, 2022, we have released updated Drought indicator data (API indicator named spei_norm under hazard: water_stress), rescaling values to a more intuitive range and increasing the number of source models used to construct the metric from 5 CMIP6 models to 21 CMIP6 models. With the new Drought rescaling, drought index (SPEI) values fall between an easy to interpret 0 to 1 range, reaching index values of 1.0 if the drought exposure are at unprecedented levels relative to the 1950 to 2014 historical period and value of 0.0 indicating no drought exposure. The increase in contributing CMIP6 models to our product will provide better model ensembles with more representative confidence intervals in the forward-looking drought projections.</p>

<p><strong>Wildfire Forward Looking Projection Data</strong></p>

<p>As of April, 2022, the Climate Explorer backend data source for Wildfire Burned Area Fraction and Historic Fire has been updated to include a high spatial resolution mask of  non-burnable areas. The dataset now includes  higher resolution land cover masks to determine if an area is at risk of fire or has seen historic fires. For existing customers, there may be underlying data changes in those assets<em>, especially those</em> bordering urban/rural boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Historic Fire Data</strong></p>

<p>As of April, 2022, Sust Global now has an automated historic fire data ingestion process.  Historic fire data in Climate Explorer is now derived from a satellite feed, and continuously displays the latest data as soon as it is released.</p>

<p><strong>UI Change – Project Switch Feature</strong></p>

<p>As of April, 2022, our UI has changed to include a simpler way to switch between projects in the top right bar of Climate Explorer.</p>

<p><strong>Drought Indicator Data Rescale</strong></p>

<p>Beginning May 2, 2022, we will release updated Drought indicator data, rescaling values to a more intuitive range and increasing the number of models used to construct the metric from 5 CMIP6 models to 21 CMIP6 models.</p>

<p>With the new Drought rescaling, drought index (SPEI) values fall between an easy to interpret 0 to 1 range, reaching index values of 1.0 if the droughts are unprecedented relative to the 1950 to 2014 historical period. With the substantial increase in contributing CMIP6 models, we have greater confidence in the forward-looking drought projections and estimates of uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>API Indicator Metadata Change</strong></p>

<p>As of April, 2022, Sust Global’s Indicator level metadata has changed. Below is an example of how to secure indicator level metadata from our API:</p>

<p><strong>Climate Explorer UI Changes</strong></p>

<p>As of March 2022, there has been a UI update to the Climate Explorer Risk Exposure dashboard. The first four plots (the Scenario based Exposure Summaries and Historic and Projected Risk Exposure) can now all be configured via a single set of drop downs.</p>

<p align="center">
<img height="300" src="assets/images/ui.png">
</p>

<p>Additionally, the drop down label for “Asset Grouping” has been renamed to “Mapping.”</p>

<p>The number following the asset display name is the “portfolio index” (see below example of WORLDCITIES_500) represents the row index of the asset in the originally-uploaded CSV file.</p>

<p><strong>New Hazard – Water Stress Score</strong></p>

<p>As of Monday, March 7th, 2022, Sust Global has added a new hazard type: Water Stress. This hazard covers a water stress score and drought (normalized <a href="https://spei.csic.es/">SPEI</a>) as indicators. Additionally, there are plans to roll out a historic water stress score in the near future</p>

<p>Water Stress is now live in Climate Explorer, and includes the following description in the <a href="https://developers.sustglobal.com/userguide.html">User Guide</a>:</p>

<p>We model current and forward-looking water stress scores using the World Resource Institute’s Aqueduct model. The state-of-the-art Aqueduct model has been extensively used by researchers in academia and industry to assess portfolio water risk.</p>

<p>The presented water stress score is the ratio of water withdrawal to renewable water availability. Water withdrawal incorporates a diverse set of global data sources, including: population, livestock, agriculture, irrigation, and other socioeconomic factors. They encompass domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock uses. Renewable water availability, which includes surface and groundwater pools, is calculated using a global hydrological model that incorporates meteorological and landscape characteristics.</p>

<p>In basins experiencing high water stress (&gt;0.4), withdrawals are large relative to renewable available water, indicating greater competition for water resources. This ratio can exceed 1.0 when non-renewable water sources like aquifers are accessed, and in practice we clip any outliers exceeding 4.0. We also interpolate values in missing years.</p>

<p>Currently, all climate models are run under the High Emissions or Middle of the Road scenarios with CMIP5-based meteorological inputs, so the water stress score values presented for the Strong Mitigation scenario are identical to those in the Middle of the Road scenario. Simulations were also only run out to 2050, so exposure values for 2051-2100 represent the mean over the 2030-2050 period. We plan to expand our offering to include a Strong Mitigation scenario and to extend beyond 2050 in a future product update.</p>

<p><strong>New Hazard Views: Wildfire Susceptibility &amp; WIldfire Burned Area Fraction</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, March 7th, 2022, new hazard labels were added for wildfires in Climate Explorer: Wildfire Susceptibility &amp; Wildfire Burned Area Fraction. In Q2 2022, we will have additional updates to historic data.</p>

<p>Thresholds for this hazard have been updated within the <a href="https://developers.sustglobal.com/explorer.html">Quickstart Guide</a>, &amp; the <a href="https://developers.sustglobal.com/userguide.html">User Guide</a> has been updated with the following information:</p>

<p><strong>Wildfire: Burned Area Fraction</strong></p>

<p>We represent annual fire risk by aggregating CMIP6 model simulations of monthly wildfire burned area [% of grid cell]. Wildfire <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921818116303770?via%3Dihub">models</a> incorporate factors such as temperature, precipitation, land cover type, and population to simulate fire occurrence and the associated area burned. We use our proprietary methodologies for wildfire super resolution <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2020/45">NeurIPS2020 technical reference on</a> top of the model ensemble to enable high resolution wildfire projections. These projections are further processed using the latest satellite derived land cover maps, filtering for the urban-wildland interface to further refine the projections.</p>

<p>For example: fire occurrence includes both lightning and human-induced ignitions, and high temperatures and drought lead to drier fuels and increased likelihood of fire.</p>

<p><strong>Wildfire Susceptibility</strong></p>

<p>We also use fire weather as an indicator of fire risk. This indicator shows the average annual probability of a fire occurring within a kilometer of the asset location. We derive this indicator based on the historic functional relationship between fire weather and the daily probability of fire, taking into account on-the-ground characteristics like land cover types and climate zones that constrain vegetation types and structure. We then apply this functional relationship based on historic observations to ensembled CMIP6 predictions of future weather to estimate future fire probabilities.</p>

<p>When estimating fire risk for a given asset, we take the average risk over all land cover types within 1 kilometer. Thus, for an asset that has 50% urban areas and 50% forested areas within 1 kilometer, the fire probability is the mean of the fire risk for these two land cover types.</p>
