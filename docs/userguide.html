<a class="anchor" href="#what-can-you-do-with-climate-explorer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What can you do with Climate Explorer?</h2>

<p>Our Climate Explorer dashboard product provides you with physical climate risk analysis information, which can be used for reporting, risk management and strategic planning needs.</p>

<p>Our data on annualized hazard exposure is derived from multiple climate models. These models generate midterm (15 year) and long term (30 year) projections. While we provide annualized exposure data across all indicators, across all supported scenarios, this data can be most reliably used as 5, 15 or 30 year aggregates to cover near term, midterm and long term risk exposure. We provide asset level hazard exposure summaries over these three time windows as well.</p>

<h3 id="uploading-a-portfolio">
<a class="anchor" href="#uploading-a-portfolio" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uploading a portfolio</h3>

<p>To create a new portfolio, go to the <a href="https://explorer.sustglobal.io/portfolios/">Portfolio View</a> on Climate Explorer and click on the button labeled New Portfolio. When creating a new portfolio, make sure that the name has no spaces in it. Having given the portfolio a name, you can upload information on the physical assets.</p>

<p>An example of a portfolio CSV file can be found here: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sustglobal/dev-center/master/resources/example_portfolio.csv">demo portfolio</a>. This demo portfolio is a useful starting point if you are interested in building your own portfolio for use in Climate Explorer, whether via UI or API. Simply right click on the demo portfolio link above, select ‘Save Link As’, and add a .csv extension to the file name (so it becomes example_portfolio.csv) and this will change the file to a CSV. Open the portfolio file and add your assets before uploading the portfolio on the <a href="https://explorer.sustglobal.io/portfolios/">Portfolio View</a> on Climate Explorer as described above. Each of the supported fields in the portfolio CSV file is documented below:</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">label:&lt;KEY&gt;</code></td>
      <td>
<strong>Optional.</strong> Additional labels (any column header prefixed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">label:</code>) are preserved in the results, and are not meaningful to Climate Explorer.</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Note that the geocodes (lat/lng coordinates) of all the physical assets in your portfolio are the only required fields. If you only have addresses and not the geocodes, you can use the Mapbox Geocoding Playground to secure geocodes for a specific address. Alternatively, you can also secure the geocodes from Google Maps by copying the numbers in the URL. 
If you would like to ‘anonymise’ the risk graphics that appear on the dashboard views, you can use the entity_id field to do so. Simply, entity_id field is preferred to the lat and lng field. By doing so, this will effectively ‘hide’ the coordinates in the dashboard views.</p>

<p>Portfolios are currently limited to 5000 assets in size. Additional account-level portfolio size limits may apply. Please contact sales@sustglobal.com to increase your portfolio size limits.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-graph-controls">
<a class="anchor" href="#using-the-graph-controls" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using the graph controls</h3>

<p>Within Climate Explorer, each graph allows for real-time configuration and analysis. On the top right of each graph, you can zoom-in and out, pan, and hover to configure your data in real-time.</p>

<p>Please refer to this <a href="https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/getting-to-know-the-plotly-modebar/">guide</a> on how to use the graph controls, including zoom, pan, hover and reset. <a href="https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/zoom-pan-hover-controls/">Here</a> is a more interactive version where you can practice using the graph controls yourself.</p>
