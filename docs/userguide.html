            <h1>Climate Explorer User Guide</h1>
            <p>The Climate scenario analysis platform from Sust Global allows operational risk analysts, quantitative modelers and ESG analysts to assess historic, near-term and long-term impacts of climate change. We provide historic risk exposure scores for fires, floods and cyclones over the past 11 years (Jan 2010- Dec 2020). For forward-looking projections of extreme physical climate hazards, we provide risk exposures across standardized climate scenarios.</p>

<p>In this User Guide, we: give an overview of the outputs from climate scenario analysis; describe the hazards that we are covering in our analysis; describe the different views available within our platform; and provide guidance on interpreting the results from our climate scenario analysis.</p>

<h2 id="climate-scenarios">
<a class="anchor" href="#climate-scenarios" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Climate Scenarios</h2>

<p>Our climate scenario analysis  follows definitions set forth from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 6 <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change">IPCC CMIP6</a>. The IPCC AR6/CMIP6 combines frontier climate science from world leading scientific institutions with realistic climate scenario modeling.</p>

<p>This guide covers the following three distinct climate scenarios:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Strong Mitigation:</strong> This scenario covers the optimal sustainable path, also referred to as the Green Road (SSP1-RCP2.6). It encompasses socioeconomics and representative emissions pathways for a graduate and pervasive global shift towards a more sustainable future. Carbon emissions begin to decline around 2020 and global mean temperatures rise approximately 2°C by 2100, a key goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Middle of the Road:</strong> This scenario covers a middle path, with challenges to climate mitigation (SSP2-RCP4.5). In this scenario, environmental systems experience degradation, and although there are some improvements. overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. This is a likely scenario if governments and policy reflect a strong sense of urgency towards climate adaptation. This is a likely scenario if governments and policy reflect a strong sense of urgency towards climate adaptation. Global mean temperatures rise approximately 3°C by 2100.</li>
  <li>
<strong>High Emissions:</strong> This scenario covers a future where the world continues on its current trajectory (SSP5-RCP8.5). There is continued reliance on competitive markets to produce rapid technological progress. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There is a high reliance on fossil fuels, with emissions peaking around 2090 and global mean temperatures rising approximately 5°C by 2100.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="physical-hazard-modeling">
<a class="anchor" href="#physical-hazard-modeling" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Physical Hazard Modeling</h2>
<p>We report on 7 acute physical hazards at the asset level: wildfire, drought, heatwaves, flooding, sea level rise, tropical cyclones, and water stress. The modeled results are stored as time series for each specific asset within a portfolio of assets.</p>

<h3 id="wildfire">
<a class="anchor" href="#wildfire" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wildfire</h3>

<h4 id="wildfire-burned-area-fraction">Wildfire Burned Area Fraction</h4>
<p>We represent annual fire risk by aggregating CMIP6 model simulations of monthly wildfire burned area [% of grid cell]. Wildfire <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921818116303770?via%3Dihub">models</a> incorporate factors such as temperature, precipitation, land cover type, and population to simulate fire occurrence and the associated area burned. For example, fire occurrence includes both lightning and human-induced ignitions, and high temperatures and drought lead to drier fuels and increased likelihood of fire. We use our proprietary methodologies for wildfire super resolution <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2020/45">NeurIPS2020 technical reference</a> on top of the model ensemble to enable high resolution wildfire projections. These projections are further processed using the latest satellite-derived land cover maps, filtering for the urban-wildland interface to further refine the projections.</p>

<h4 id="wildfire-susceptibility">Wildfire Susceptibility</h4>

<p>We also use fire weather as an indicator of fire risk.  This indicator shows the average annual probability of a fire occurring within a kilometer of the asset location.  We derive this indicator based on the historic functional relationship between fire weather and the daily probability of fire, taking into account on-the-ground characteristics like land cover types and climate zones that constrain vegetation types and structure.  We then apply this functional relationship based on historic observations to ensembled CMIP6 predictions of future weather to estimate future fire probabilities.</p>

<p>When estimating fire risk for a given asset, we take the average risk over all land cover types within 1 kilometer.  Thus, for an asset that has 50% urban areas and 50% forested areas within 1 kilometer, the fire probability is the mean of the fire risk for these two land cover types.</p>

<h3 id="drought">
<a class="anchor" href="#drought" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Drought</h3>
<p>To estimate an asset’s exposure to drought, we utilize a drought index based on CMIP6 simulations of precipitation and temperature, from which we estimate potential evapotranspiration. This is the more suitable index for agricultural assets like farms and farm production sites. Drought scores range from 0 [low exposure] to 1 [high exposure]. Values between 0.5 and 0.67 indicate moderate dryness, while values above 0.67 indicate severe dryness. These values represent a simple rescaling of calculated SPEI values designed to be more interpretable. The rescaling sets SPEI values above 0 (wet) to 0, reverses the sign, and normalizes by 3.0. Drought index values are calculated relative to a historical 1950-2014 baseline period, and future droughts can reach index values of 1.0 if the droughts are unprecedented relative to the 1950-2014 historical period.</p>

<h3 id="heatwaves">
<a class="anchor" href="#heatwaves" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Heatwaves</h3>
<p>For heatwaves, we calculate the number of days per year exceeding a temperature threshold. The temperature threshold at a given location is based on the local, daily conditions during a baseline period between 1980 and 2010. Because this temperature threshold varies by location, the heatwave metric indicates anomalously high temperatures relative to what is typical at the local level.</p>

<h3 id="inland-flooding">
<a class="anchor" href="#inland-flooding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inland Flooding</h3>
<p>We base our modeling of inland riverine flooding exposure on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0257-z?WT.feed_name=subjects_hydrology">recent advances</a> in combining climate models, hydrological models, local flood defense data, and high-resolution elevation maps. Coastal flooding from sea level rise or storm surges are not considered in this metric. When calculating whether a flood will occur, the framework incorporates local resilience information, such as 1 in 100 year design thresholds for dams and levees, based on a <a href="https://www.un-spider.org/links-and-resources/data-sources/flopros-evolving-global-database-flood-protection-standards-vrije">global atlas</a> of flood defenses.</p>

<p>The output metric we derive for inland flooding exposure ranges from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk) based on a collection of 50 simulations of inundated areas. The 50 simulations are derived from combining projections of variables like precipitation and humidity from 5 climate models with 10 hydrological models that simulate daily runoff levels. Then, high-resolution inundation modeling is performed using satellite-derived elevation maps that provide detailed views of local river networks. A value of 0 ( the most common since inland floods are inherently rare) indicates none of the simulations predicted a flood.</p>

<p>Currently, all climate models are run under the High Emissions scenario, so the flood exposure values presented for the Strong Mitigation and Middle of the Road scenarios are identical to those in the High Emissions scenario. We plan to expand our offering to all three scenarios in a future product update. When representing the heatmap, we look at the number of years over which 5% or above (&gt;0.05) probability of flooding is projected at the asset over a 30-year time horizon in order to categorize the asset as either LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH risk.</p>

<h3 id="sea-level-rise">
<a class="anchor" href="#sea-level-rise" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sea Level Rise</h3>
<p>We utilize sea level rise models to estimate sea level rise exposure for assets within 5 kilometers of the coast. Projected sea level rise from CMIP6 climate models incorporates the effects of thermal expansion from warming of the ocean. Since water expands as it warms, thermal expansion is expected to be the primary component of future sea level rise. The models do not incorporate the secondary contributions of melting glaciers and ice caps, so simulations are conservative estimates of total sea level rise. Incorporating these secondary contributions would not impact the relative risk between asset locations; rather, it would likely lead to a stronger distinction in risk between the high and low emissions scenarios, though these distinctions are unlikely to manifest until at least 2050. In our assessments, we express sea level rise relative to a 1980-2010 baseline period for assets within 5km from the coast. An asset’s distance to the nearest coastline is derived using high-resolution, NASA satellite-derived estimates of coastline locations. Assets
beyond 5km from the nearest coastline are assumed to have no sea level risk in our assessments.</p>

<h3 id="tropical-cyclones">
<a class="anchor" href="#tropical-cyclones" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tropical Cyclones</h3>

<p>For forward-looking cyclone exposure, we combine the latest CMIP6-based cyclone track simulations with Sust’s bias-correction methodology to enable more accurate assessment of local exposure. The CMIP6-based cyclone track simulations are drawn from research led by the UK Met Office and the UK Centre for Environmental Data Analysis. These novel high-resolution simulations are only achievable due to recent advancements in supercomputing.</p>

<p>We implement a multi-step bias-correct procedure to ensure forward-looking cyclone track simulations are more representative of intense, Category 3/4/5 tropical cyclones. We achieve this by applying correction factors to simulated wind speeds and comparing simulated cyclone tracks with observational data in high-impact coastal regions. Overall, Sust’s bias-correction steps reduce the ensemble mean error rate in coastal validation regions by up to 92%.</p>

<p>Currently, all climate models are run under the High Emissions scenario, so the cyclone exposure values presented for the Strong Mitigation and Middle of the Road scenarios are identical to those in the High Emissions scenario. Simulations were also only run out to 2050 due to their substantial computational cost. Therefore exposure values for 2051-2100 represent the mean over the 2030-2050 period. We plan to expand our offering to all three scenarios and beyond 2050 in a future product update.</p>

<h3 id="water-stress-score">
<a class="anchor" href="#water-stress-score" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Water Stress Score</h3>

<p>We model current and forward-looking water stress scores using the World Resource Institute’s Aqueduct model. The state-of-the-art Aqueduct model has been extensively used by researchers in academia and industry to assess portfolio water risk.</p>

<p>The presented water stress score is the ratio of water withdrawal to renewable water availability. Water withdrawal incorporates a diverse set of global data sources, including: population, livestock, agriculture, irrigation, and other socioeconomic factors. They encompass domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock uses. Renewable water availability, which includes surface and groundwater pools, is calculated using a global hydrological model that incorporates meteorological and landscape characteristics.</p>

<p>In basins experiencing high water stress (&gt;0.4), withdrawals are large relative to renewable available water, indicating greater competition for water resources. This ratio can exceed 1.0 when non-renewable water sources like aquifers are accessed, and in practice we clip any outliers exceeding 4.0. We also interpolate values in missing years.</p>

<p>Currently, all climate models are run under the High Emissions or Middle of the Road scenarios with CMIP5-based meteorological inputs, so the water stress score values presented for the Strong Mitigation scenario are identical to those in the Middle of the Road scenario. Simulations were also only run out to 2050, so exposure values for 2051-2100 represent the mean over the 2030-2050 period. We plan to expand our offering to include a Strong Mitigation scenario and to extend beyond 2050 in a future product update.</p>

Fig 7: Risk Heatmap View
</p>

<p>This view shows the heatmap of forward looking risk for a selected physical hazard type. We project physical risk over the 30 year window between 2021 and 2050 and look at the maximum risk exposure to a specific hazard for an asset. We use the maximum risk exposure value to color code the asset to LOW (Green), MEDIUM (Yellow), or HIGH (Red) risk categories. <a href="https://developers.sustglobal.com/explorer.html">Climate Explorer QuickStart Guide</a></p>

<h5 id="methodology-description">Methodology description</h5>
<ol>
  <li>For a selected SSP, we would look at the maximum value of risk exposure over the 2021-2050 analysis time window for all hazards with the exception of sea level rise (SLR) and 2021-2100 for SLR as the input to the risk summary view. This is to account for sea level rise being a longer term hazard, having more profound exposure over the second half of the century.</li>
  <li>
    <p>For each hazard, we then identify the maximum risk exposure value of each asset over all the years in the analysis time window and use that value as input to a classification of LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH. Note that for drought (SPEI), we would use the negative of the value in the risk exposure datasets (negative drought (SPEI) values indicate risk). For flooding, we use the number of years within a 30-year period where the risk exceeds a preset threshold (5%). This is to simulate a flood exceedance threshold from the flood exposure values.</p>
