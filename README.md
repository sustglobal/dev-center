## Documentation

The documentation source in this repo is built and published to https://developers.sustglobal.com/.
Please head to that URL if you only need to read the docs.

If you wish to contribute changes to the docs, please follow the guidance below.

### Working with the Docs

The majority of local documentation is built using Jekyll (all markdown docs in ./jekyll/).
Local development depends on having a proper Ruby environment set up.
Documentation is available here:
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll.

Once you have ruby and bundler installed, you should be able to run the following from `./jekyll/` and see the
documentation site up at `http://localhost:4000`:

```
bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Note that jekyll reads from the `./jekyll` directory, then places rendered files in `./docs`. This means that you should
NEVER edit files in `./docs` by hand, as your changes will be overwritten.

### Building and Publishing Docs

Since we rely on a nonstandard jekyll plugin, we actually have to build the site locally and check it in directy.
Assuming you have a working dev environment (see above), you can just run the following and check in the result.

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

The static files generated by jekyll end up in `./docs/`, so be sure to include this when you commit your work.
Open a PR to this repo containing your new commit(s), and the team will review and merge it.

Upon a merge to master, Github Pages will automatically pick up your changes and publish to https://developers.sustglobal.com/.

### Python Client Docs

The [python client docs](https://developers.sustglobal.com/py/index.html) are built using Sphinx.
This tool automatically reads docstrings as well as some limited rst files, then renders styled HTML.
Build these docs with the script in `./clients/`:

```
./clients/tools/build-docs.sh
```

Generated documentation will bypass the jekyll toolchain and land directly into `./docs/py`.
Commit these changes directly to the repo and the static site will be deployed automatically.
