## Before Getting Started

 Please note that you must change the sections of text in brackets **[  ]** to suit the specific values, hazards and scenarios you are describing.

## What are the CSV datasets?

Comma separated value (CSV) files contain the physical climate risk and financial impact analysis information from Visual Summary Dashboard product, which can be used for strategic planning needs. The CSV files are useful if you would like to use the underlying data to create your own graphs or charts for a report or presentation, to undergo further analysis (such as data aggregations, comparisons between assets etc.) or as an input into your Excel models.

Likewise, the data is provided in geojson format for your convenience.
