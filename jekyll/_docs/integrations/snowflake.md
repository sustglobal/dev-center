## Analyzing Utilities Through Snowflake

Here is an example of US energy and utility assets grouped by issuers/holding companies across the states of California, Hawaii, and Florida. These asset level locations are from [Spatial Risk Systems](https://spatialrisksystems.com/) (SRS). We provide two dropdown selectors: one for issuer and one for hazard. On Snowflake, the SRS datasets can be found [here](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listings/Spatial%20Risk%20Systems) and the Sust Global datasets can be accessed [here](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZ2FQZRVGX1/sust-global-physical-climate-risk).
