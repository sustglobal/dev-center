## Why Admin Boundaries?

Administrative divisions or boundaries are sub-sovereign geographical areas, often with their own system of administration or governance. They frequently coincide with economic zones, or concentrations of economic activity. This is useful with regards to physical risk exposure, as isolating physical risk by zone can lead to greater insights. For example, comparing coastal zones, which could be impacted by cyclones, to interior zones, which might be exposed to heatwaves or water stress, gives a more holistic picture across business interests. Further, this product can be easily integrated into analysis with widely used boundary-native datasets such as US Census data (e.g., county-level GDP) for deeper analysis of climate-driven impacts on society (see our [Multimodal Guide](visual-summary-multimodal-guide) for an example).

## About the Data

Derived from our industry-leading high-resolution hazard models, Sust Global's admin boundaries dataset provides zonally-aggregated physical risk exposure scores, and financial impact metrics, to help risk management and risk reporting teams across financial and sustainability organizations assess the impact of climate change on their portfolios, operational assets and supply chains.

For each of our three metrics, physical risk exposure and the resulting structural damage and business interruption, we detail the following:

- **Two climate scenarios**: SSP2-RCP4.5 (Medium Warming) and SSP5-RCP8.5 (High Warming)
- **Four time horizons**: Baseline, 2030, 2050, and 2080
- **Six physical hazards**: Cyclones, Flooding (inland + coastal), Wildfire, Heatwaves, Water Stress, and, Sea Level Rise

## Zonal Aggregation Approach

To create our Zonal Statistics dataset, we first translate our high-resolution data to polygon-representative values. The reduction method (e.g., mean, maximum) for each hazard can be found in the [Climate Data Guide](data-guide#regional-statistics-using-polygon-processing). From these spatially aggregated hazard values, we then derive the [financial impact metrics](value-at-risk). For each of the three metrics (hazard exposure, structural damage, business interruption), we represent the inherent uncertainty of climate data by reporting lower and upper bounds of the data (i.e., 84th and 16th percentile respectively). Finally, we represent the geolocation of each administrative boundary by using the latitude and longitude of the centroid.

| SCENARIO_ANALYTICS                 | OBJ    | Contains the climate scenarios ssp245 and ssp585. Each scenario contains hazards wildfire, cyclone, flood, heatwave, water stress and sea level rise. For each hazard, data is windowed for baseline, 2030, 2050, and 2080. In turn the ubd (upper bound) and lbd (lower bound) values indicate the uncertainty for each window.
