## Nature Capital Project Views
This user guide provides an overview of the views available within the Nature Capital dashboard to aid nature-based carbon project durability risk analysis. 

### Overview
Once a project has been uploaded, the app provides a geospatial representation of risk across a project’s boundaries and detailed data on the project’s risk exposure to numerous perils. Users can select which project they’d like to assess using the orange dropdown menu in the top left part of the app. 

### Project Risk Visualizations

Upon selecting a project, users will be able to view hazard risk hotspots within their project boundaries. The visualization granularity for each hazard aligns with Sust Global’s modeled granularity for each hazard, which can be found in their [Climate Data Guide](data-guide). Risk visualizations can aid decision-making by enabling teams to identify material risk hotspots and develop mitigation strategies.  

### Project Risk Exposure Data 
In addition to risk visualizations, Sust Global also produces risk exposure data for numerous hazards. The full documentation of those data indicators can be found in the [Nature Data Guide](nature-data-guide). 

The Nature Capital data views enable users to analyze each hazard’s risk exposure aggregated across a project’s entire boundaries, or they can select a specific project subsection – which are broken down into evenly-sized parcels based on each hazard’s model resolution – to analyze risk within the subsection.

Project-level risk data can be used to support project analysis workflows, such as project valuation or quantitative risk assessment, while parcel-level views can inform strategic decision-making, such as selection locations for adaptation investment. 

### Peer Comparison
In addition to the raw score for each risk indicator, Sust Global has created a database of global forest and blue carbon projects enabling visibility into how a project’s risk exposure compares to its global peer projects.
