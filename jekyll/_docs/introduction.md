      - name: Wildfire
        description: Wildfire is an uncontrolled fire, caused by a combination of combustible fuels (such as dead, dry wood) and ignition sources (such as human activity or lightning).  It is strongly influenced by prevailing weather conditions, and typically occurs where human activity meets an accumulation of wild fuel along the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI).

      - name: Flood
        description: Flooding captures the likelihood of a location being directly exposed to flooding, both from precipitation-based inland flooding and from coastal flooding. Flooding is among the deadlier natural disasters and poses direct risks to human health, infrastructure, and economic activity.

      - name: Cyclones
        description: Tropical cyclones, also referred to as hurricanes and typhoons, are one of the costliest natural disasters. Since 1980, tropical cyclones in the U.S. have caused $997 billion in damages (NOAA), exceeding damages from all other weather disasters. Cyclone impacts can be widespread, including coastal and inland flooding and wind damage. These damages can affect livelihoods, assets, critical infrastructure, and economic activity.

      - name: Heatwaves
        description: Heatwaves represent an extended period of perilously warm weather at a specific location or region. They are associated with excess mortality and other human health risks, greatly increased electricity demand, agricultural impacts, and disruption to many types of economic activity.

      - name: Sea Level Rise
        description: Global mean sea level increased by approximately 20cm in the past century, with 1 meter or more of rise expected by 2100. The major physical impacts of rising seas include coastal flooding, erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers, inundation of deltas, and loss of biodiversity in marshes and wetlands.

      - name: Water Stress
        description: Water is a requirement for societal development and progress, and its availability plays a critical role across a wide variety of activities.  This includes food security, human health, electricity generation, manufacturing and mining. Changing water availability due to climate change, coupled with increasing demand from population growth and economic activity, will have substantial impacts across the globe. Rigorous, high resolution water supply and demand data is therefore needed to enable assessment of water risk exposure, both directly and throughout supply chains. Projections of future water availability can help companies and investors prepare for the complex economic and social challenges related to water stress.

  - title: Financial Risk Metrics
    description: More information about Sust Global's financial risk metrics.
    docs:
      - name: Value at Risk
        description: Physical hazards can cause direct damage to the built environment. The resulting financial risks can be quantified by leveraging publicly available relationships that map hazard exposure values (e.g., 1 meter flood depth) to asset-level impacts (e.g., 30% damage to structure). These relationships are called <i>damage functions</i> and are discussed in greater detail in the Methodology section.
